## VI. Gameplay

### Mechanics
#### Runner
The runner can run forwards, backwards, and jump. The challenge comes from reaction time and
prediction
skills.
#### Devil
The devil can use currency built up over the course of the game to activate increasingly powerful
abilities.

### Control
#### Runner
The runner can tap on the run forwards, run backwards, or jump buttons.
#### Devil
The devil can tap on the ability they want to activate.

### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"
The buttons for both the runner and devil will be easy to understand icons for quick pickup and play.

### Player learning
The runners need to learn what the devils can do and when and try to predict when abilities will come out to be in an advantageous position. The devils need to learn what each of their abilities can do and how to group effect for the best results.
